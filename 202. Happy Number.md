# 202. Happy Number
## Description

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

## Code: Python
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isHappy(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        l = {}
        Sum = 0
        
        while 1:
            while n:
                res = n % 10
                Sum += res*res
                n = n // 10
                
            if Sum == 1: 
                return True
            
            if Sum in l: 
                return False
            else: 
                l[Sum] = 1
            
            n, Sum = Sum, 0
```

## Idea
The key is to figure out **if the number is looping endlessly**. Therefore, we can think in this way:
1. If the number is happy, it won't loop. Becasue when it starts looping before finding a `1`, the following sum would be a repeat of the numbers in the looping circle, and it won't get a `1`. 

2. On the basis of the upper idea, if the number is happy, it won't have any repeated sum in any process. 
Because when it repeats, it has got in a loop, which goes against the upper idea.

3. Now we know that a happy number won't have repeated process. But any number that have un-repeated process must be a happy number?
The answer is **Yes!**

4. As we know, the `Sum` of the number `abc` is `Sum = a^2 + b^2 + c^2`. When `abc = 999`, its sum would larger than any other 3-digit numbers.
And `Sum = 81 + 81 + 81 = 243 < 999`, which means, any following sum of a 3-digit number would smaller than `999`. 
Let's extend it to n-digit! It also means, any n-digit number's results would smaller than `99999....(n times)`.

See? Becasue the possible sum of any process is smaller than a fixed integer -> the process is not endless.
So if a number has un-repeated process, it would eventually traversal all the sum, and get a `1`

**Summary:** We just record the value of the sum of each process in a dic `L`, and keep searching.
If a sum-value is already in 'L', it means this number has repeated process. Apprantly it's looping endlessly, and it won't be happy. Then we return `False`.
If `sum == 1`, then congratulations! We have found our happy number!
