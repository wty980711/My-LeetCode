# 0004. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:
        lenA, lenB = len(nums1), len(nums2)
        total = lenA + lenB
        A, B = nums1, nums2
        if lenA > lenB:
            lenA, lenB = lenB, lenA
            A, B = B, A
      
        half = total // 2 # here is a trick
        l, r = 0, lenA - 1 # try partition position between [i,j] for A
        
        while (1):
            i = (l + r) // 2
            j = half - i - 2 # B's corresponding partition position
            
            # special case1: A = [|a1 a2 a3], then Aleft = -inf, Aright = a1
            # special case2: A = [a1 a2 a3|], then Aleft = a3, Aright = inf
            Aleft = A[i] if i >= 0 else -math.inf
            Aright = A[i + 1] if i + 1 < lenA else math.inf
            # The same special cases also apply to B
            Bleft = B[j] if j >= 0 else -math.inf
            Bright = B[j + 1] if j + 1 < lenB else math.inf
            
            if Aleft <= Bright and Bleft <= Aright:
                if total % 2:
                    return min(Aright, Bright)
                else:
                    return (max(Aleft, Bleft) + min(Aright, Bright)) / 2
            elif Aleft > Bright:
                r = i - 1
            else:
                l = i + 1
```

## Idea

First, let's rename two arrays as `A` and `B`, and let's assume that `len(A) <= len(B)`, if not, just swap them.

The total lenght of A and B is `total = lenA + lenB`, and `half = total // 2`. If there is a median, it must partition both A and B into two parts:

```python
A = [a1 a2 a3|a4 a5]
B = [b1 b2|b3 b4 b5]
# len = 5 + 5 = 10
# half = len // 2 = 5
# i = 2
# j = half - i - 2 = 1
```

Why we use half? Because if we merge A and B into one sorted array, there will be `half - 1` numbers on the left of the median (when there are even numbers), or there will be `half` numbers on the left of the median (when there are odd numbers). 

Therefore, when we assign a partition position for A (e.g. `i = 2` in the above case), there will always be a corresponding partition position for B (`j = half - i - 2`), because the total number of elements of left partitions are fixed (`half`).

Then, the question enolves into finding a proper `i` using binary search.

So, when will the binary search finish (we find the median)? Let's assume the max in the left partition of A is `Aleft`, the min in the right partition of A is `Aright`. Similarily, there will also be `Bleft` and `Bright`. For example, in the above case: `Aleft = a3, Aright = a4, Bleft = b2, Bright = b3`.

If we found a median, the following relationships will be satisfied:

```python
Aleft <= Aright and Bleft <= Bright # without any doubt
Aleft <= Bright and Bleft <= Aright # all numbers in left partitions are <= all numbers in right partitions
````

The, we will choose the median from `Aleft, Aright, Bleft, Bright`.

When `total ` is even, `median = (max(Aleft, Bleft) + min(Aright, Bright)) / 2`; When `total` is odd, `median = min(Aright, Bright) `.

If above relationships are not satisfied, we will keep searching, and there will be two cases:

-  `Aleft > Bright`: this means `Aleft` we choose is too large and `Bright` is too small, so we should move the partition position of A towards left: `r = i - 1`
- `Bleft > Aright`: this means `Bleft` we choose is too large and `Aright` is too small, so we should move the partition position of A towards right: `l = i + 1`
