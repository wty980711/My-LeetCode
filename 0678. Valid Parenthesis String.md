# 678. Valid Parenthesis String
## Description
Given a string containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '\*', write a function to check whether this string is valid. 
We define the validity of a string by these rules:

1. Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
2. Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
3. Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
4. '\*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string.
5. An empty string is also valid.

## Code: Python
```python
class Solution(object):
    def checkValidString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not s:
            return True
        
        if s[0] == ')':
            return False
        
        rst = [0]

        for c in s:
            temp = rst
            if c == '(':
                temp = [i+1 for i in temp]
            elif c == ')':
                temp = [i-1 for i in temp]
            else:
                temp = []
                for i in rst:
                    if i + 1 not in temp:
                        temp.append(i+1)
                    if i not in temp:
                        temp.append(i)
                    if i - 1 not in temp:
                        temp.append(i-1)
            rst = []
            for i in temp:
                if i >= 0:
                    rst.append(i)
        
        return (0 in rst)               
```

## Idea
Let's use 3 different numbers to define the characters: 
```
'(' = +1
')' = -1
empty = 0
```
We use `rst` to restore the possible result when traversing. The initial `rst` is 0.
Then we traverse the string, during which there would be 3 situations:
1. current character is '(': Apparently, we just add 1 to every element in `rst`
2. current character is ')': Let every element minus 1. 
3. current character is '\*': We know that '\*' can represent `'(', ')', empty`, so we just restore all 3 possible results in `rst`.

E.g. if the string is '()\*', after traversing first 2 characters, `rst = [1-1] = [0]`. After the '\*', there would be a 3-branch new result `rst = [1, 0, -1]`.

However, after above step, some elements in `rst` may be less than 0, which means for some branches have more ')' than '(' in previous part of the string, apparently it's invalid. So we just kick them out and remain the other branches.

When we finish traversing, we just check if there is a `0` in `rst`. If there is, we know that the string is valid during some situation.
