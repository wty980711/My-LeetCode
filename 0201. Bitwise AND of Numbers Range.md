# 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range
## Description
Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

## Code: Python3
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        i = 0
        while m != n:
            m >>= 1
            n >>= 1
            i += 1
        return m << i
```

## Idea
**Example:**

Let's assume that the range is:
```
[m = 0bxyz0acd, n = 0bxyz1rst]
```
where xyzacdrst are digits in base 2.

In this example we can tell that `m` and `n` share the same digits in first 3 bits(`xyz`), and become different in the following bits.
Then, we pick out two special number within the range [m,n], they are:
```
m' = 0bxyz0111
n' = 0bxyz1000
```
When we do `m'` bitwise AND `n'`, we get:
```
m' & n' = 0bxyz0000
```
Since all bits after `'0bxyz'` are `0`, the bitwise AND result of the range [m,n] would definately equal to:
```
rangeBitwiseAnd(m, n) = 0bxyz0000
```

**Conclusion:**

For any `m` and `n`, there fist several bits may be same(like `0bxyz` in the example), but for the following different bits 
we are sure to find 2 special number(like `m'` and `n'` in the example) to make the result become `0bxyz0000`.

So, our job is to keep the same bits from left to right, and set following different bits to `0`
