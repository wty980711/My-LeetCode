# 127. Word Ladder
## Idea
### Question Analysis
Different words as like differents nodes, and if there are two words that have only one different letter, we can create an edge between them.

Thus, our questions becomes finding the shortest distence between 2 nodes in a graph. For this question, **BFS** is no doubt the best method.

### Construct A Graph
e.g. word `cat` can connect to 3 different templates: `*at`, `c*t`, `ca*`

And we can create a hash map, and the templates would be the keys, and the words would be values

### Bidirectional BFS
Generally, we would start BFS from the `beginWord`, until we find the `endWord`. However, if each node has many edges, the time cost will increase exponetially. 

To reduce our effort, we could start BFS both forward and backward. And the search process will end if we find a same word from both forward search and backward search (the shortest step = forward step + backward step).
