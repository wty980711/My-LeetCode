# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Idea

The basic idea is to use `sliding window` to keep track of a substring without repeatation. Each time we expand the window, we update the longest range.

There is also possibility that we need to shrink the window. Assuming the window range is `[i, j)`, and there is a repeating element at `x (i <= x < j)` that `s[x] == s[j]`. Therefore, we need to shrink the left boudary `i`.

So when can we stop shrinking? It should be when `i = x + 1`. Because if `i <= x`, `s[x]` will always in the window's range, and there will be repeating characters.

But how do we know the position of `s[x]`? We can maintain a hash table, and the key is the character, the value is the character's index. In above case, it would be `hmp[s[x]] = x`.

Now let finish the logic.

- Each time after the window expands (`j` move to the right), we let `hmp[s[j]] = j`.
- Each time before the window expands, we will check if `s[j] in hmp`. If yes, there is a repeating element in the past, and its position is `x = hmp[s[j]]`. Then we'll shrink the left boundary. We will first compare `i` and `x + 1`. Why? Becasue we want to check if `x` is in the range of `[i, j)`. If `x` is before `i`, there is no need to shrink because the repeating character is not in the window range.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        hmp = {}
        i = 0
        rst = 0

        for j in range(len(s)):
            if s[j] in hmp:
                i = max(i, hmp[s[j]] + 1)

            rst = max(rst, j - i + 1)
            hmp[s[j]] = j

        return rst
```
