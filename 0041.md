# 0041. First Missing Positive
## Idea
### O(n)
We can use a list `l` to represent the occurence of each number.

e.g., `l[i] = 1` means number i is in `nums`, `l[j] = 0` means number j is not in `nums`

now we have:
- l[key] = val
- key -- numbers in nums
- val -- whether the key number is in nums

By traverse `nums`, we can record each number's occurence in `l`.

Then, traverse `l`, we can find the minima pos number k that `l[k] = 0`.

### constant extra space
However, how large `l`'s size should be? We need use `l`'s key to represent every number.

Think about an instance: `nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 9999]`. In this case, we are supposed to use `l[9999] = 1`, however, the final result is only 4.

Let's do some optimization: Suppose `n = len(nums)`, then the minima missing positive value is at most (n+1). e,g.:
- nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], 5 is missing
- nums = [0, 1, 2, 3], 4 is missing
- nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2], 3 is missing

Therefore, we can do optimizations in two aspects:
- ignore all negative numbers, because we want a positive number
- ignore all numbers that larger than n, because the missing number is no larger than (n+1)

To achieve this, we simply traverse `nums`, and set these numbers to 0, then we can create a list with constant size = n+1 (0,1,2...n)

## code
```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        l = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        # !!!
        # if nums[] has n objects, the missing value is at most (n+1)
        # eg.: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], 5 is missing
        #      nums = [-1, 1, 2, 3], 4 is missing
        #      nums = [1, 2, 3, 5], 4 is missing
        for i in range(n):
            if (nums[i] < 1 or nums[i] > n):
                nums[i] = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            l[i] = 1
        
        i = 1
        while (i <= n):
            if (l[i] == 0):
                return i
            i = i + 1
        
        return i
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time: O(n) for traverse `nums`, O(n) for traverse `l`. O(n) in total
- Space: O(1) since it is constant
