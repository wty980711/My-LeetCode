```python
class Solution:

        t_dict = Counter(t)
        t_num = len(t_dict)

## Idea - Sliding Window
### How to find a qualified window
Use `t_dict` to hold the characters and their counts in `t`.

Use `t_num` to represent the number of unique characters in `t`

>e.g. if `t = "aab"`, then `t_dict = {"a": 2, "b": 1}, t_num = len(t_dict) = 2`

Similiarly, use `cur_dict` to hold the characters and their counts in the current window of `s`. 

Use `cur_num` to represent how many unique characters have satisfied the requirement of `t_dict`

>e.g. if `cur_dict["a"] == t_dict["a"]`, it means the count of "a" in current slidding window equals to the count in `t`, so we have found enough "a". And then we let `cur_num += 1`

If `cur_num == t_num`, it means all characters in `t` have been found in the slidding window. Then, we need to check if this *qualified window* can get smaller.

### Adjust the window's boundary
We use two pointers `l` and `r` as the boundary of the window.

1. We keep `l` still, and move `r` forward until we get a *qualified window* according to the last part. Then, we should try to make this window smaller.

2. To achieve this, we start to move `l` forward. If the window is still qualified, we get a smaller window and record its boundary position. Then, keep moving `l`.

3. Untill the window is *not qualified*, we stop moving `l`, and start moving `r` to find a new qualified window and make it smaller. (Repeat step 1 and 2)

4. When `r` reaches the end of `s`, the window can't be enlarged, we are finished

## Complexity Analysis
- Time: O(t + s), where O(t) for creating `t_dict`, O(2\*s) for left and  right pointer
- Space: O(t + s), where O(t) for `t_dict`, O(s) for `cur_dict` (when the window size is similar to s)
