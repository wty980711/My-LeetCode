# 41. First Missing Positive
## Description
Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.

**Example:**
```
Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3
```
**Note:**

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.

## Code: Python
```python
class Solution(object):
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        nums.append(0)
        n = len(nums)
        
        # delete useless elements
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]<0 or nums[i]>=n:
                nums[i]=0
        
        # create hash
        for i in range(len(nums)): 
            nums[nums[i]%n]+=n
        
        # search missing integers
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i]//n==0:
                return i
            
        return n    
```
This solution is proposed by @`asones` from Leetcode, and the link is:

## Idea
Pay attention to the requirement: **Time complexity is O(n) and Space complexity is O(1)**

So we can not use sort algorithm or regular hash table.

@`asones`'s idea is to delete useless elements in the list(by setting them to 0), and use the original list's index as hash,
so that the space complexity wont increase.

Let's try in following steps:
1. For given list `nums`, let `n = len(nums)`, the missing pos integer must range from [1, n+1]. 
Apparently it's ok that the left boundary is 1, but why the right boundary is n+1. The corressponding situation would be:
```python
## All elements in nums is contiguous
nums = [1,2,3]
n = len(nums) = 3
> The missing integer is 4 (n+1)
```
To further explain it, let's assume that the missing integer is `n+2`. In this case, `n+1` should exist in `nums`. 
However, the length of `nums` is n. If `n+1` is an element in `nums`, there must be one missing integer that ranges from [1,n], which is against the assumption.

2. *Why nums.append(0)?* Let's figure out later.

3. In the first for-loop, traverse the list, and delete all useless elements that in the outside of [1,n+1].

4. Now, none of elements in `nums` is lager than n, in other words, `nums[i]//n = 0 `. In the second for-loop, create special hash.
After finishing this loop, the new `nums` has 2 definations:
```
a. new_nums[i]%n == prev_nums[i], which successfully restores original elements in previous `num`
b. new_nums[i]//n, which can reflect that if element `i` is missing.
```

5. In the third for-loop, traverse to find the missing interger.
