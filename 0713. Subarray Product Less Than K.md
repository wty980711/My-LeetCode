# 713. Subarray Product Less Than K

## Idea

Basicly, we can use slide window and calculate the product of numbers in the window.

However, the fundamental problem is: how may subarrays we should add to the result when the window expands?

I'll give u an example: supposed `k = 10`, and current window is `w1 = [1, 2, 1]`.

Now, if the next number is `4`, the window can be expanded to `w2 = [1, 2, 1, 4]`.

So based on the result of `w1`, how many additional subarrys we should add to the result for `w2`? It should be:

- `[4]`
- `[1, 4]`
- `[2, 1, 4]`
- `[1, 2, 1, 4]`

In conclusion, if a new number is appended to the window, there will arise `l - r + 1` new qualified subarrys.

Based on this, we can expand the window and add to the result gradually.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        if k <= 1:
            return 0

        product = 1
        l = 0
        ans = 0

        for r in range(len(nums)):
            product *= nums[r]
            while product >= k:
                product /= nums[l]
                l += 1
            ans += (r - l + 1)

        return ans
```
