# 0162. Find Peak Element

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while l < r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        
        return l
```

## Idea

pre-knowledge:

- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]`
- You can return any peek

Since we have `mid` in each loop, what do we do for the next step?

Ideally, we need to find: `nums[mid] > nums[mid - 1] and nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]`, however, we actually don't need to check both sides of mid.

Remember that we can return any peek we found? Therefore, we only need to check the right side of mid, and there will be several cases:

- `nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]`: this is impossible according to the regulation
- `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`: this means mid is definately not a peek, and there will definately be a peek on the right of mid, so let `l = mid + 1`. In this case, we don't need to care about whether there will be a peek of the left of mid. (because we can return any peak)
- `nums[mid] > nums[mid]`: this means there will definately be a peek among mid and its left, so let `r = mid`. In this case, we don't need to care about whether there will be a peek of the right of mid. (because we can return any peak)
