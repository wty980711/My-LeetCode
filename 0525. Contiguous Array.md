# 525. Contiguous Array
## Description
Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

## Code: python3
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMaxLength(self, nums):
        count = 0
        max_length=0
        table = {0: 0}
        for index, num in enumerate(nums, 1):
            if num == 0:
                count -= 1
            else:
                count += 1
            
            if count in table:
                max_length = max(max_length, index - table[count])
            else:
                table[count] = index
        
        return max_length
```

## Idea
We use variable `count` to restore current result when traversing the list. 

When we meet a `1`, let `count+1`; Similarly, when we met a `0`, we let `count-1`.

Then we put count and corresponding index into a hash table. In order to find the maximum length of a continuous subarray, we just need to consider 2 situations:

**Situation 1:** `count[k] = 0`
This situation means from the beginning to the kth number, the number of 0 and the number of 1 are equal. 
```
// k = 1, 3
input = [0, 1, 1, 0]
count = [-1, 0, 1, 0]
```

**Situation 2:** `count[i] = count[j]`
This situation means from ith number to jth number, the number of 0 and the number of 1 are equal.
```
// i = 0, j = 2
// i = 2, j = 4
// i = 0, j = 4
input = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
count = [-1, 0, -1, -2, -1]
```

Whenever we find a proper situation, we can calculate the corresponding length and compare it with the current maximum length. When we finish traversung the whole array, the final maximum length would be the result.
