# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer
## Idea
### Deep Copy
Deep copy is simple, just allocate a new address to create a new node, and them copy the old node's int value to the new node.

After deep-coping the current node, we then need to deep copy the `next` and `random`.

Also, we need to matain a hash map `visited`, whenever we copy a new node, we should set `visited[old_node] = new_node`. So that we can directly find the corresponding copied node of an old node.

### Random & Next Pointer Copy
There might be 3 different situations during copying the pointer.
1. It points to node that has been copied, then we can simply use `new_node.pointer = visited[old_node.pointer]`. e.g. `node10.random = node1`
2. It points to a node that is not been copied yet, then we just copy this node and mark it in the `visited`. e.g. `node2.random = node5`
3. It points to `None`, then we just return a `None`. e.g. `node3.random = None`

## Code
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""

class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.visited = {None: None}
        
    def cloneNode(self, old):
        if old in self.visited:
            return self.visited[old]
        new = Node(old.val)
        self.visited[old] = new
        return new
        
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not head:
            return None
        
        dummyhead = Node(head.val)
        new = dummyhead
        old = head
        self.visited[old] = new
        
        while old is not None:
            new.random = self.cloneNode(old.random)
            new.next = self.cloneNode(old.next)
            new = new.next
            old = old.next
        
        return dummyhead
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time: O(N) because we just visit every node one time
- Space: O(N) because we need to matain a hash map of N elements
