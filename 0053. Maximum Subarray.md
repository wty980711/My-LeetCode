# 53. Maximum Subarray
## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

## Code: Python
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # DP
        local_solution = nums[0]
        global_solution = local_solution
        
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            local_solution = max(nums[i], local_solution + nums[i])
            global_solution = max(global_solution, local_solution)

        return global_solution
```

## Idea
Apparently, in this problem we need to traverse all members of the array, and update the solution. 
So DP would be efficient and simple.

When we traverse the members, we introduce `local_solution` and `global_solution`.

```
local_solution is the best solution that contains the current member
global_solution is the best solution among all members' local_solution
```

So let's start with `local_solution = nums[0]`, because there's no other solution.
Then, we start traversing, for each member `num[i]`, there would be 2 possible local_solution:
1. When the local_solution of num[i-1] is positive, the local_solution of num[i] undoubtedly equals to `local_solution(num[i-1]) + num[i]`
2. When it's non-negative, the local_solution of num[i] equals to `num[i]`

So we can use `max` function to pick the larger one.
