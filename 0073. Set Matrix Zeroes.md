# 73. Set Matrix Zeroes
## idea
### constant space
Generally speaking, we can use an additional matrix to record row and column number of zero.

However, there is a way to use original matrix itself to record the infromation. First we traverse the matrix, and do:

```python
if (matrix[i][j] == 0):
	# we set:
	matrix[i][0] = 0
	matrix[0][j] = 0
```

Then we traverse the matrix for a second time to finish the modification. For each `matrix[i][j]`, we do:

```python
if ((matrix[i][0] == 0) or (matrix[0][j] == 0)):
	matrix[i][j] = 0
```

### tips
Because the first row and the first column record the information, when we do modification, we should start from the second row and the second column. After finishing other cells, we go back to modify the first row/ column. 

e.g. if the original matrix is:

```python
[[0, 1, 2],
 [3, 4, 5],
 [0, 6, 7]]
```

If we start modification from the first row by doing

```python
for i in range(rows):
	for j in range(columns):
```

it will become:

```python
[[0, 0, 0],
 [3, 4, 5],
 [0, 6, 7]]
```

After finishing all rows, it becomes:

```python
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

```python
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0]) 
        r0_zero = False
        
        for i in range(m):
            if (matrix[i][0] == 0):
                r0_zero = True
            for j in range(1, n):
                if (matrix[i][j] == 0):
                    matrix[i][0] = 0
                    matrix[0][j] = 0
        
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                if ((not matrix[i][0]) or (not matrix[0][j])):
                    matrix[i][j] = 0
        
        if (matrix[0][0] == 0):
            for j in range(n):
                matrix[0][j] = 0
                
        if (r0_zero):
            for i in range(m):
                matrix[i][0] = 0
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time: O(m*n) for traverse matrix to mark. O(n) for traverse matrix to modify
- Space: O(1) no additional space
